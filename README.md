## Overview

This project predicts energy consumption in residential spaces using the Appliances Energy Prediction dataset. The dataset contains various environmental and indoor features, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and energy consumption of different appliances.

The objective is to apply and compare the performance of Linear Regression and Decision Tree models in predicting energy consumption.

## Features

**Data Analysis**: Explore and preprocess the dataset to identify trends and relationships.

**Model Training**: Train Linear Regression and Decision Tree models.

**Model Comparison**: Evaluate models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² Score.

**Visualization**: Plot results for better understanding and interpretation.

## Tech Stack

**Python**: Programming language.

**Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for writing and running code.

**Libraries**:

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: Numerical computations.

matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization.

sklearn: Machine learning algorithms and utilities.

## Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:
```
git clone <energy-prediction-repo-url>
cd energy-prediction-repo
```

Install required libraries:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```

Run the notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions.

## Key Metrics

**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.

**R² Score**: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.
